            My name is Evan Jones, I am a 19 year old aspiring Tattoo Artist currently in my second year in the Graphic Design program at Algonquin College. 
            I didnt pass this course last semester for a myriad of reasons so I'm retaking it now! I have a wonderful partner, Gabriella, who took that photo of me, as well as 
            many freinds i enojy spending time with. 
        </p>

            I enjoy sketching, and drawing, especially with markers and pens, and I hope to start a tattoo aprenticeship this summer and hopefully start that career after I graduate. I also enjoy being outside, going on hikes, biking, canoeing, fishing etc.
            Right now during the winter there arent too many activites I enjoy doing but im looking forward to summer.
            Some of my other hobbies include art and outdoor activites as mentioned above, but I am also interested in card games like Magic: the Gathering, as well as board games like Settlers of Catan, 
            Risk, and many others. I recently discovered model building as a hobby and have been having a great time doing that with friends.
